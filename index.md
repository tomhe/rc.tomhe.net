# Welcome

Here you can find plans, designed by [me](https://tomhe.net), for depron RC airplane models. Currently I have plans for pusher prop jets and plans for 3D aerobatics.

In plain English this means that

- you may not use my plans for commercial purposes
- if you make any changes to the plans and want to publish or share your version you have to
  - attribute me as the original designer with a link to this web site

I'd appreciate if you would send me pictures of your builds if you use any of my plans.

Now go and cut some foam!
