# Welcome

Here you can find plans, designed by [me](https://tomhe.net), for depron RC airplane models. Currently I have plans for pusher prop jets and plans for 3D aerobatics.

Pusher-prop jets:
* [Eurofighter Typhoon](./eurofighter/)
* [F-16 Fighting Falcon](./f-16/)
* [F-22 Raptor](./f-22/)
* [F/A-18 Super Hornet](./fa-18/)
* [MiG-29 Fulcrum](./mig-29/)
* [Su-37 Super Flanker](./su-37/)

3D aerobatics:
* [Sukhoi Su-31](./su-31/)

* * *

I'd appreciate if you would send me pictures of your builds if you use any of my plans.

Now go and cut some foam!
