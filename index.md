# Welcome

Here you can find plans, designed by [me](https://tomhe.net), for depron RC airplane models. Currently I have plans for pusher prop jets and plans for 3D aerobatics.

Pusher-prop jets:
* [Eurofighter Typhoon](./eurofighter/)
* [F-16](./f-16/)
* [F-22](./f-22/)

3D aerobatics:
* [Sukhoi Su-31](./su-31/)

I'd appreciate if you would send me pictures of your builds if you use any of my plans.

Now go and cut some foam!
