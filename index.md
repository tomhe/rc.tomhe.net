# Welcome

Here you can find plans, designed by [me](https://tomhe.net), for depron RC airplane models. Currently I have plans for pusher prop jets and plans for 3D aerobatics.

In plain English this means that
- you are free to download my plans and build airplane models from them
- if you make any changes to the plans and want to publish or share your version you have to
  - attribute me as the original designer with a link to this web site
  - release your version under the same or similar license to this one
- you may not use my plans for commercial purposes

I'd appreciate if you would send me pictures of your builds if you use any of my plans.

Now go and cut some foam!
