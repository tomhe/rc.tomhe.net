# Description

The Eurofighter Typhoon is a mid-mounted pusher model. It is intended to be flown with tailerons only, but I've also made markings for a rudder. Build it from the plans attached below.

You will have to mark out and cut the slot for the motor.

The dimensions of the slots and tabs are made for 6 mm depron.
