# Sukhoi Su-37 Super Flanker

![Sukhoi Su-37 Super Flanker](./13.jpg)

## Description

The Sukhoi Su-37 is an aerobatic 3D plane that is intended for outdoor use. Build it from the plans attached below.

I have marked out a slot for the motor, but you might want to modify it to for your particular motor and mount. I have included a motor mount that fits the slot.

This is quite a large model, so make sure to user proper reinforcements on the wing and elevator, like stiff carbon fiber rods.

The dimensions of the slots and tabs are made for 6 mm depron.

Use the [6mmFlyRC MiG-29 instruction manual](../docs/quick-build-mig-29.pdf). The build steps are mostly the same.
